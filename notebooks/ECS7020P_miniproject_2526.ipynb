    "# 2 Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a supervised machine learning model that, given a single 10 seconds audio recording of a person humming or whistling, predicts which song (from the dataset) the recording corresponds to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Formal Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Let 𝑋 be the space of audio records of fixed duration (10 s) and Y = {1,…,C} the set of song labels. From a training set $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$ drawn IID from an unknown distribution, learn a mapping that generalizes to unseen samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_{\\theta} : X \\to Y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model takes an audio clip (x) and outputs a predicted song label (ŷ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning objective is to minimize empirical classification error (or equivalently maximize accuracy) on a validation set. Secondary goals include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Robustness to pitch variation:** A model still predicts the right song even if someone hums 2 semitones higher.\n",
    "* **Robustness to tempo variation:** If someone hums the melody too fast or too slow, the model still recognizes it.\n",
    "* **Interpretability of learned features:** Understanding what the model is using to make decisions, i.e. pitch shape, rhythm, MFCCs, mel patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Inputs & Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** 10 seconds audio clip (.wav format). Preprocessing will convert this to one or more feature representations.\n",
    "* **Output:** Discrete song ID (Class label)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Challenges and Relevance of Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying a song from a short humming or whistling recording presents several challenges that make the task both difficult and interesting. Because the audio contains only the melodic line without instrumentation, lyrics or harmony, the model must rely almost entirely on pitch contour and temporal structure. This is further complicated by substantial variability between recordings: different users may hum at different tempos, in different keys, with varying degrees of vibrato, background noise, or pitch stability. These factors create high intra-class variability, making it harder for a model to learn consistent patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the dataset is relatively small (approximately 400–800 samples), which increases the risk of overfitting, especially for deep learning models. This makes the problem a valuable opportunity to explore feature engineering, regularisation, and robust validation strategies. The task also suffers from label ambiguity because short 10-second segment may not capture uniquely identifying melodic segments; many popular songs share similar short melodic fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these challenges highlight why this problem is relevant for machine learning research: it requires designing models that emphasize relative melodic movement rather than absolute pitch, implementing data augmentation to address variability, and evaluating how different feature representations influence classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.5 Success Criteria and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary metric** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Accuracy on a validation set: the percentage of validation samples for which the model predicts the correct song.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Top-k accuracy: Many songs have similar melodic fragments. The model may confuse them but still get the correct song in its top few predictions. Useful when melodies are short or ambiguous.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Confusion matrix: A table showing which songs are mistaken for which other songs. It helps to understand patterns of mistakes, not just the error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Per-class precision: to measure how reliable the model’s predictions are when it labels a clip as a specific song.\n",
    "* Per-class recall: to evaluate how well the model manages to find all examples of each song, especially those that are harder to recognize.\n",
    "* Per-class macro F1: to obtain a balanced measure that treats every song equally, ensuring that classes with fewer samples are not overshadowed by larger ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model assessment: Besides numeric scores, we will analyze common confusions and error cases, and inspect which features (e.g., MFCCs vs. pitch contour) contribute most.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.6 Constraints and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "This project assumes that all audio recordings in the dataset have a fixed duration of 10 seconds; in cases where this is not true, the clips will be padded or truncated to ensure consistent input length. Additionally, we assume that the provided labels accurately reflect the true song identity and treat them as ground truth throughout training and evaluation. Finally, we assume that the training and validation samples are independent and identically distributed (IID), meaning that each sample is drawn independently from the same underlying distribution. This assumption allows the validation performance to serve as an unbiased estimate of generalization, although in practice small datasets and possible similarities between recordings may limit this ideal.\n"

    "# 3 Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This project approaches the task of predicting the song identity from a 10 second hum or whistle by designing a supervised multi-class classification pipeline. The methodology consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining training task\n",
    "2. Defining validation task\n",
    "3. Selecting appropriate performance metrics\n",
    "4. Specifying auxiliary tasks that support model development such as feature extraction and exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Training Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The training task is to learn a classifier function $f_{\\theta}$ parameterized by ${\\theta}$ (model parameters), which maps audio recordings $x \\in X$ to song labels $y \\in Y = \\{1, \\ldots, C\\}$. The classifier is trained on a dataset of labelled audio samples, where each instance consists of a 10 second waveform and its corresponding song identifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters ${\\theta}$ are optimized to minimize empirical classification loss. For most models, this corresponds to the cross-entropy loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log p_{\\theta}(y_i \\mid x_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing and feature extraction (e.g., log-mel spectrograms or MFCC coefficients) are treated as an integral part of the training task to ensure that the classifier receives consistent and informative representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Validation Task\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess generalization, the dataset is partitioned into independent training and validation datasets. The validation task evaluates the trained classifier on unseen audio recordings, providing an unbiased estimate of performance. All hyperparameter choices (e.g., feature configuration, model capacity, learning rate, regularization) will be selected based on validation results. The validation set is strictly held out and never used during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ensure that the data split mimics the IID assumption by randomly assigning samples to each set, while noting any potential limitations such as class imbalance or similarity between samples. The validation task therefore supports model selection, early stopping, and error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary metric used to evaluate model performance is classification accuracy, defined as the proportion of validation samples whose predicted label matches the ground truth:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\mathbf{1}\\{ f_\\theta(x_j) = y_j \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* M: Total number of samples in the validation set\n",
    "* $x_j$: The input of the 𝑗-th example.\n",
    "* $y_j$: The true label (correct song ID) for sample 𝑗.\n",
    "* $f_{\\theta}(\\cdot)$: The trained classifier with parameters θ.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, accuracy alone may overlook class imbalance or patterns of misclassification. Thus, we additionally consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Confusion matrix, to visualize which songs the model tends to confuse.\n",
    "* Per-class precision, recall, and F1 score, to understand performance across all labels.\n",
    "* Top-k accuracy, useful when melodic similarity leads multiple songs to share similar contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics support a deeper analysis of model behaviour beyond a single scalar score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4 Auxiliary Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Several auxiliary tasks are included to improve the overall robustness of the pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exploratory data analysis: inspecting waveform statistics, label distribution, and audio examples.\n",
    "2. Feature engineering: comparing multiple representations (e.g., MFCCs, log-mel spectrograms) to evaluate which contain the most informative melodic structure.\n",
    "3. Data preprocessing: normalizing audio amplitudes, resampling to a consistent sample rate, and padding/truncating to fixed duration.\n",
    "4. Data augmentation: introducing pitch shifts, time-stretching, or noise injection to simulate variability in human humming.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks provide insights and help mitigate overfitting given the limited dataset size."

    "# 4 Implemented ML Prediction Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores a multi-stage machine learning pipeline designed to predict the identity of a song from a 10-second hum or whistle. The three pipelines implemented follow a structured flow consisting of two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transformation stage that converts raw waveforms into suitable features\n",
    "2. Model stage that performs multi-class classification\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Each stage transforms the intermediate data into a new representation, progressively moving from raw audio to song predictions. The pipeline is modular, enabling each component to be analysed and evaluated independently, while also allowing alternative approaches to be compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure for all pipelines is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw Audio Waveform → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → ML Model → Predicted Song Label\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each pipeline, the input is the raw waveform sampled from the dataset, and the output is a class label corresponding to one of the possible songs.

    "## 4.1 Transformation Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation stage converts the raw audio waveform into a numerical feature representation suitable for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** One-dimensional audio signal (time-domain waveform)\n",
    "* **Output:** Two-dimensional or one-dimensional feature tensor, depending on the chosen representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ensemble stage was not implemented in this study primarily due to the relatively small dataset size. Ensemble methods typically require multiple well-trained, diverse models to achieve performance gains, and with limited training samples per song, individual models risk overfitting. Adding an ensemble under these conditions would likely amplify overfitting rather than improve generalization. Therefore, we focused on evaluating and comparing single-model performance to obtain clearer insights into how each modeling approach handles the hummed and whistled melody classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire transformation stage flow consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw waveform → preprocessing → feature extraction → feature tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing, which is performed prior to feature extraction to ensure consistency across all samples, consists of: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Resampling: Converts all audio clips to a common sampling rate, ensuring that frequency-related features are comparable across samples.\n",
    "* Amplitude Normalization: Scales the signal to a consistent loudness level so that models focus on pitch and timbre rather than volume differences.\n",
    "* Trimming/padding to a fixed length (10 seconds): Trimming and padding adjust every audio clip to the same duration, allowing all feature tensors to have uniform shapes required by machine learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main feature extraction approaches are explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients): MFCCs capture the coarse spectral envelope of the audio and are widely used in speech and humming recognition. They produce a 2D matrix of size (number frames × number coefficients).\n",
    "For classical machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), this matrix is flattened into a 1D feature vector, as these models require fixed-length vectors as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Log-Mel Spectrograms: Log-mel spectrograms retain richer time–frequency detail and are more suitable for modelling melodic structure. They produce a dense 2D representation, similar to an image. This representation is kept in 2D form for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), since CNNs naturally operate on image-like inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for these transformations is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Humming contains pitch contours and harmonic structures that are not sufficiently captured by raw waveforms. This is well suited for Log-mel spectrograms, since they preserve harmonic structure, timbre, and pitch contours very well.\n",
    "* Most successful audio classification models rely on time–frequency representations that resemble images, making them suitable for convolutional neural networks. Log-mel spectrograms give those representations.\n",
    "* MFCCs provide a compact representation that can be flattened into a 1-dimensional feature vector, making them computationally efficient and well-suited for algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, and SVMs that require fixed-length inputs.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail, the three pipelines flow consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression Model:** Raw waveform → preprocessing → MFCCs → flattened 1D feature vector\n",
    "2. **Random Forest Model:** Raw waveform → preprocessing → MFCCs → flattened 1D feature vector\n",

    "However, the dataset has structural constraints that limit true independence. Multiple recordings from the same participant, with similar humming/whistling habits, appear in both the training and validation sets.

Therefore, although the split is statistically IID, it is not completely identity independent.\n",

    "**Overall Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest shows a similar pattern to the Logistic Regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validation accuracy is low (0.25)\n",
    "* Test accuracy on the smaller 400-sample dataset is high (0.6)\n",
    "* Test accuracy on the larger 800-sample dataset is also high (0.78)\n",
    "\n",
    "This behaviour indicates that the model struggles during validation on the training domain, but generalises surprisingly well to external datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined with the confusion-matrix metrics, this suggests that Random Forest is not learning a deeply discriminative representation during training, but still captures broad MFCC-based acoustic patterns, which transfer well across datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons Why Validation Accuracy Is Low**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MFCC features cause information loss: MFCCs compress the audio heavily, removing pitch contour and fine-grained humming structure.\n",
    "Random Forests cannot recover the lost harmonic/temporal relationships, leading to weaker in-domain learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Forests struggle with very high-dimensional flattened MFCCs: Flattened MFCC matrices produce feature vectors with thousands of coefficients.\n",
    "Tree-based models perform poorly when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of features ≫ number of samples\n",
    "* Features are continuous and noisy\n",
    "* Many features are highly correlated (MFCC frames are almost identical over time)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This leads to unstable splits and lower validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Validation uses augmented-free audios while training uses augmented audio\n",
    "\n",
    "    This creates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A domain gap between the augmented training distribution and the clean validation distribution.\n",
    "* Random Forests cannot generalise well across distribution shifts, unlike neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary Metrics Intepretration**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision and recall are inconsistent across classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Friend: reasonable recall (0.45) = The model predicts this class more frequently\n",
    "* Married: low recall (0.10) = The model fails to recognise this song\n",
    "* Happy: both precision (0.12) and recall (0.15) are low = difficult class\n",
    "* NewYork: low precision (0.20) and low recall (0.20) = not very easy to distinct the melody\n",
    "\n",
    "This inequality suggests:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some songs have more distinctive MFCC patterns\n",
    "* Others might have overlapping frequency envelopes when hummed\n",
    "* The model tends to confuse songs with similar spectral shapes\n",
    "* Songs with subtle or smoother humming shape (e.g., Married, Happy) are often missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Macro F1 = 0.25**\n",
    "\n",
    "Macro treats all classes equally. Low macro F1 means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Underperformance is not isolated to a couple of songs\n",
    "* The model struggles globally, not just with rare classes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weighted F1 = 0.25**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since each class has the same number of samples, weighted F1 does not distort the view. Thus, the low F1 truly reflects real class-level difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model captures broad MFCC patterns well enough to generalise to external datasets but fails to learn robust class-specific representations, leading to low validation performance and uniformly weak precision/recall across classes."

This step enables efficient batching, GPU processing, and stable model convergence. Additionally, data augmentation is applied during training to improve generalisation."

    "The training procedure outlines how model parameters are optimized. The CNN is trained using the Adam optimizer, which adapts learning rates based on gradient statistics. Early stopping is applied to prevent overfitting by halting training when validation performance ceases to improve, and learning rate scheduling helps stabilize convergence by reducing the step size once training plateaus. This systematic training strategy ensures efficient optimization and promotes better generalization to unseen humming recordings."

This stage serves multiple purposes: it allows hyperparameter tuning, monitors overfitting during training, and informs early stopping decisions for the CNN. Using a validation set ensures that performance estimates reflect generalisation to unseen data rather than memorization of training samples."

    "**Overall Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN achieves a validation accuracy of 36.25% and similar test accuracies on Dataset A (36%) and Dataset B (35.38%). This shows that the CNN slightly outperforms the classical models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) on this task, though overall performance remains moderate. The model is able to capture some melodic and harmonic patterns, as evidenced by higher top-3 (64.38%) and top-5 (88.12%) accuracies, indicating that even when the top prediction is incorrect, the true song is often among the top candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasons Why Validation Accuracy Is Low**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several factors likely contribute to the relatively low validation accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small per-class sample size: With only 16 training samples per song, the CNN cannot fully learn generalizable features across participants.\n",
    "* High variability in humming/whistling: Differences in pitch, tempo, and personal vocal characteristics make classification challenging.\n",
    "* Underfitting / insufficient representation: The CNN may require more data or stronger augmentation to capture the subtle distinctions between songs.\n",
    "* Sparse correct predictions for some classes: Classes like Feeling, Friend, and TryEverything show zero recall, indicating the model struggles with certain songs, likely due to lack of training samples or higher melodic similarity with other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary Metrics Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Per-class performance: Certain songs (Happy, Necessities, NewYork) achieve high recall (0.8–0.9), suggesting the CNN is able to reliably detect a subset of songs with distinctive melodic patterns. Conversely, some songs have zero recall, highlighting imbalance in learnable features across classes.\n",
    "* Macro F1 (0.2475): Reflects the average per-class performance; low value indicates strong class imbalance and poor generalization to harder-to-learn classes.\n",
    "* Top-k accuracy: Top-3 and top-5 accuracies (64.38% and 88.12%) reveal that while the CNN struggles to predict the exact top song, it frequently ranks the correct song among the most probable predictions. This aligns with the musical context where many melodies share similar fragments."

    "# 7 Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we explored the automatic classification of hummed and whistled melodies using three different models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We implemented consistent preprocessing pipelines, including amplitude normalization, resampling, padding/truncation, and data augmentation and extracted features appropriate for each model (MFCCs for classical models and log-Mel spectrograms for CNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classical models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) achieved moderate test accuracies (~69–71%) but low validation accuracies (~30%).\n",
    "* The CNN slightly outperformed classical models in validation accuracy (36.25%), and its top-k accuracies demonstrated that it frequently ranks the correct song among the top predictions, even if the top-1 prediction is incorrect.\n",
    "* Overall, all models struggled with songs that had limited or highly variable samples, highlighting the challenges of small datasets and participant variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset is relatively small, which limits the ability of models, especially CNNs, to learn robust representations.\n",
    "* High variability in human humming and whistling introduces noise that classical feature-based models cannot fully capture.\n",
    "* Certain songs were consistently misclassified, indicating possible melodic similarity or insufficient distinguishing features in the input representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increase dataset size, either by collecting more recordings or using advanced data augmentation techniques.\n",
    "* Explore more expressive feature representations, such as pitch contours, chroma features, or learned embeddings.\n",
    "* Consider more advanced architectures for the CNN to better capture temporal dependencies and melodic patterns.\n",
    "* Investigate ensemble approaches combining classical models with neural networks for improved robustness.\n",
    "* Evaluate additional metrics such as top-k accuracy, per-class F1, and confusion patterns to better understand model weaknesses and guide targeted improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This work demonstrates the feasibility of automated melody classification from hummed or whistled inputs but also highlights the challenges inherent in small, variable datasets. Future work should focus on expanding the dataset, improving feature representations, and leveraging modern deep learning techniques to enhance model generalization.\n"
